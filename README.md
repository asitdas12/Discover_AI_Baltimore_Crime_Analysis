By: **Asit Das, Macawan Luu, Satwik Nijampudi**

Project completion: Spring 2022

## Summary

**Baltimore Crime Analysis** is a Python application that **Identifies clusters of Baltimore homicides using k-means algorithm.**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

For creation of clusters, the following classifiers are implemented: 
- [x] K-Means

Additionally, a visualization of the clusters of homicides has been displayed on top of the Baltimore Metropolitan Area with Matplotlib. Data was pulled from the Baltimore Government. 

<!-- ## Video Demo
